//1. ST JOB is Preprocessor (12s)
// for each page starts section detection and signeture detection| and with pages start PSD if images.
//  [section detection], each section detected starts reading order.
//  reading order starts section clasification.
//	section clasification starts NER
//  NER starts FE
//

//Person and signature detection each: ~8s each (PSD)

//Section detection: ~5s (SD)

//Reading order: average 300ms, but it can be as high as 50 seconds in rare cases (RO)

//NER: ~35s (NER)

//Feature extraction: ~250ms
// section clasification. 22 mean Seconds (8 - 58)

// Page of a PDF

// So each entry represents a document, each document has on average 1.8 pages.
// And 2.3 images
// Each image gets a job in the person and signature detection queue.
// Each page gets a job in the section detection queue
// After section detection, there are an average of 6.7 sections. Each section gets a job in the reading order queue.
// After reading order, each of those jobs goes to NER, then feature extraction.
